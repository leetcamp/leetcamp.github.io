The dawn of an hacker movement for good.

Partner project with [Layman-docs](https://layman-docs.github.io/).
We hack and document, but we mainly hack. For our objective is doing stuff.

### Pillars:
- Conscientia
- Per aspera, ad astra
- Benivolencia

## Explanation

### Consciencia
Consciousness and knowledge, be aware of your surroundings and motivations.

Your expression in your work will be more true. First word, best word. 

Be passionate about knowledge, seek what makes you go nuts.

Spontaneity is key in every step of creation.


### Per aspera, ad astra

Through hard work, to the stars. Fear not working sleepless nights for what
drives you. 

Stop excusing yourself. Accept it, work it and overcome it. 

We're all noobz at every point in our lives.

### Benivolencia

Do good, be inspiring, be active, don't be passive in your community. 

Creative minds are gifted, not using it for the benefit of all is 
nothing, but a crime.

At the tips of your fingers lies big power, to move mountains, planets, and 
galaxies.

## Questions

### Do I fit in?
If you want to learn, study and help the world, the answer is yes. If not so,
remember us.

### So what do we do?
Initially, we hack our own projects, be master to ourselves. If it can be
shared and help others in their road, the better. Most important must be to
have fun.
